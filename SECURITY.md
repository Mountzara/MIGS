## False Positive Secrets

This repository contains HTML exported from Canva. The HTML files may contain
patterns that look like API keys or secrets but are actually just design elements
from Canva's export process. These are not actual secrets or API keys.

If GitHub's secret scanning detects these patterns, they can be safely marked
as false positives.
