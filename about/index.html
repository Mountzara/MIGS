            <p>At the intersection of surgical mastery and educational innovation stands Dr. Christopher Mabini, a board-eligible minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon whose journey reflects a profound commitment to advancing healthcare through both technical excellence and compassionate practice.</p>

            <h2>A Journey Shaped by Purpose</h2>
            <p>Dr. Mabini's path to becoming a surgical specialist began with a deeply personal challenge when his mother passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2005. Finding himself unexpectedly at the helm of the hospice organization she had founded, he drew upon his premed background, sports experience, and performing arts discipline to navigate this unfamiliar territory. Through diligent leadership and a dedication to teamwork, he successfully guided the organization to achieve Joint Commission accreditation, an accomplishment that taught him invaluable lessons about purpose-driven work and the power of perseverance.</p>
            <p>This formative experience instilled in Dr. Mabini a philosophy that good work ethic combined with meaningful purpose creates a foundation for success—a philosophy that continues to guide his approach to medicine today. His Filipino heritage, which he honors through cooking traditional dishes, also provides him with a space for creative problem-solving and reflection that parallels his surgical practice.</p>

            <h2>Surgical Excellence Through Innovation</h2>
            <p>Now completing his Fellowship in Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery at PRIME Illinois St. Francis Hospital, Dr. Mabini has distinguished himself as a rising leader in the field. His pioneering research on applying indocyanine green (ICG) imaging to detect endometriosis-related fibrosis earned him the prestigious George M. Morley Award for Best Gynecological Research at the CAOG Annual Meeting in 2023.</p>
            <p>His expertise in complex hysteroscopic techniques was further recognized with the Golden Hysteroscope Award for Best Video Abstract at the 2024 AAGL Global Congress, demonstrating his talent for developing innovative approaches to challenging surgical scenarios. This accomplishment reflects his commitment to not merely achieving competence but striving for mastery that advances the entire field.</p>

            <h2>Educational Leadership</h2>
            <p>With a Master's in Adult Education specialized in curriculum development from Troy University, Dr. Mabini brings a unique perspective to medical training. As Surgical Skills Chief during his residency at Ascension Illinois St. Alexius OBGYN Residency Program, he developed comprehensive educational frameworks that integrate theory with hands-on practice.</p>
            <p>His curriculum development work extends to establishing the FMIGS institutional curriculum at PRIME Illinois Saint Francis Hospital, where he applies experiential learning principles to train the next generation of surgeons. For Dr. Mabini, the operating room and classroom are complementary spaces where innovation thrives through constant questioning and refinement of techniques.</p>

            <h2>Research as the Pulse of Progress</h2>
            <p>Dr. Mabini's research portfolio includes groundbreaking work published in respected journals such as the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology. His studies on mapping deep epigastric vessels stratified by BMI have contributed valuable knowledge to enhancing surgical safety protocols. His investigations into novel techniques for hysteroscopic removal of retained products of conception and robotic myomectomy using gel-based port systems demonstrate his commitment to finding new solutions to persistent surgical challenges.</p>
            <p>Currently, he leads multiple IRB-approved research initiatives, including studies on the use of narrow-band imaging (NBI) in detecting adenomyosis during hysteroscopy and evaluating post-operative pain management following trans-abdominal plane blocks in minimally invasive procedures.</p>

            <h2>A Vision for Healthcare's Future</h2>
            <p>For Dr. Mabini, the field of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery represents the perfect confluence of his diverse talents and interests—a space where intellectual curiosity, technical skill, educational passion, and innovative thinking combine to create something greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
            <p>His approach to medicine embraces both technological advancement and human connection, recognizing that while innovation improves techniques, compassion transforms the patient experience. This philosophy guides his practice at PRIME St. Francis Hospital in Evanston, where he continues to push boundaries in surgical care while maintaining a deep commitment to mentorship and education.</p>
            <p>As Dr. Mabini looks to the future, he remains dedicated to advancing the field of MIGS through continuous learning and creative problem-solving—always remembering that the most important innovations are those that ultimately enhance patient care and outcomes.</p>
